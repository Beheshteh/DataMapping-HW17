# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background
Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing 
scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of 
climate and land-use change. 

## Basic Visualization
1. Used this data set: (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 
 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. 

2. Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes 
from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. 
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Created a legend that will provide context for map data.
